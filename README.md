**Company_Bankruptcy_Prediction(Logistic regression)**

**Problem statement**

 Prediction of bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to firms who
stand to loose money because on unpaid debts. Since computers can store huge dataset
pertaining to bankruptcy making accurate predictions from them before hand is becoming
important. 

The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

 In this project I have used various classification algorithms on bankruptcy
dataset to predict bankruptcies with satisfying accuracies long before the actual event.
    
**Introduction** 
Bankruptcy prediction is the task of predicting bankruptcy and various measures of financial distress of firms. It is a vast area of finance and accounting research. The importance of the area is due in part to the relevance for creditors and investors in evaluating the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt. The aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric parameters which allow foreseeing the financial condition of a firm.

### Work to be done 

* **Use two different techniques to deal with unbalanced and Very Small data-set.**
* **Define non-fractional and fractional Columns and Normalize the data.**
* **Apply different Classification Models.**
* **Use calibration to calibrate the highest Model performance.**
