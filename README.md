**Company_Bankruptcy_Prediction(Logistic regression)**

**Problem statement**

 Prediction of bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to firms who
stand to loose money because on unpaid debts. Since computers can store huge dataset
pertaining to bankruptcy making accurate predictions from them before hand is becoming
important. 

The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

 In this project I have used various classification algorithms on bankruptcy
dataset to predict bankruptcies with satisfying accuracies long before the actual event.
    
**Introduction** 

Bankruptcy prediction is the task of predicting bankruptcy and various measures of financial distress of firms. It is a vast area of finance and accounting research. The importance of the area is due in part to the relevance for creditors and investors in evaluating the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt. The aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric parameters which allow foreseeing the financial condition of a firm.

### Work to be done 

* **Use two different techniques to deal with unbalanced and Very Small data-set.**
* **Define non-fractional and fractional Columns and Normalize the data.**
* **Apply different Classification Models.**
* **Use calibration to calibrate the highest Model performance.**

## Few findings
The number of organizations that have gone bankrupt in 10 years between 1999 – 2000 is few.
Several companies possess many assets, which is always a good sign for an organization.
An organization cannot guarantee not being bankrupt, although owning several assets.
The organizations in the dataset are running into losses for the past two years as their net income poses to be negative.
Very few of the organizations that have had negative income in the past two years suffer from bankruptcy.
It is observed that “Debt Ratio %, Current Liability To Assets, Current Liability To Current Assets" attributes are a few of the attributes that have a high correlation with the target attribute.
An increase in the values of the attributes “Debt Ratio %, Current Liability To Assets, Current Liability To Current Assets” causes an organization to suffer heavy losses, thus resulting in bankruptcy.
An increase in the values of the attributes that have a negative correlation with the target attribute helps an organization avoid bankruptcy.
There seems to be a relation between attributes that have a high correlation with the target attribute and a low correlation with the target attribute.
I observed several correlations among the top 12 attributes, one of which being “Net Worth/Assets and Debt Ratio %” that is negatively correlated with one another.
